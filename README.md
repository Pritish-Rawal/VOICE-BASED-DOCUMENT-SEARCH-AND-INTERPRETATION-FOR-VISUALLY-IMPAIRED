# VOICE-BASED-DOCUMENT-SEARCH-AND-INTERPRETATION-FOR-VISUALLY-IMPAIRED
The system is expected to help visually impaired people and those with reading disabilities with everyday tasks such as reading.

This system helps visually impaired people and people with reading disorders by converting
the needed text into speech and reads it out for the user. Moreover, the
user is allowed to choose from multiple options such as summarization
of the text and finding the topics available in the document with the use
of LDA. The input given by the user can be either by text or by speech,
helping those who are visually impaired to interact with the system easily. 
Lastly, for more information on any of the topics, a Google search
and a web browser history search is done. The proposed application integrates topic modeling, 
text to speech and speech recognition in order to
provide an interactive environment which makes visually impaired people and 
people with reading disorders to be more self dependent.
